# HIT137 - Group Assignment 3

## Overview

You will develop a desktop application that demonstrates your understanding of Object-Oriented Programming principles, GUI development using Tkinter, and image processing using OpenCV.

You have the flexibility to design any user interface, provided it effectively supports all
required functionality.

## Functional Requirements

 1. Image Loading
    - Select and load images, from the local device
    - Display the loaded image in the application window
 1. Image Cropping
    - Draw a rectangle using mouse interaction for image cropping
    - Provide real-time visual feedback of the selection area while drawing
    - Display the cropped result alongside the original image
 1. Image Resizing
    - Slider control for resizing the cropped image
    - Update the display in real-time as the user moves the slider

## Bonus

- Implement additional image processing features
- Add keyboard shortcuts
- Implement undo/redo functionality
